GeneNetwork / GADO backend
==========================
This is the Java netbeans project of the code used to create the prediction available on www.genenetwork.nl. The predictions are performed using `nl.systemsgenetics.genenetworkbackend.predictions.PredictGenesetMemberBasedOnTCs`. The other main classes are used for commandline based analysis which also can be performed at www.genenetwork.nl. Please note that this part of our SystemsGenetics package is aimed at internal use, you try it out if you like but it is not optimized for external use. If you are interested in using our predictions or GADO prioritizations please use www.genenetwork.nl.
