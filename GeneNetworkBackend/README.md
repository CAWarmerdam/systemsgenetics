GeneNetwork / GADO backend
===========================
This is the Java netbeans project of the code used to create the prediction available on www.genenetwork.nl. The predictions are performed using `nl.systemsgenetics.genenetworkbackend.predictions.PredictGenesetMemberBasedOnTCs`. The other main classes are used for commandline based analysis that also can be performed at www.genenetwork.nl or are used for analysis in our manuscript.
